This game is about a wizard who has misplaced a vital spell component needed to cast his most powerful spell: a spell that will him to travel into the past or the future depending on where the caster wishes to travel. However, the wizard has lost his precious and most valuable diamond and it is up to the player to find it and return it to him so that he may perform the spell.

For the theme of Vision, I elected to use dull visuals for the most part to work with this theme and only place objects of interest as well as the player in colour in order to grab the player’s attention and to give them the right indication as to where to go. These objects of interest include pumpkins to heal the player and a diamond at the end that signifies the player’s end goal.
I knew from when we first received the brief about the assignment that a 2D platformer was the type of game I wanted to make. The first idea that sprang to mind was to use a mixture of dull and vibrant colours and I immediately knew that I wanted to experiment with it. I then went onto the Unity Asset Store to find an asset pack that would allow me to achieve this, which is how I found the Brackeys asset pack. Then I moved onto sketching my idea in Adobe Photoshop, as pictured below:

I then began placing basic platforms and laying out the level:

I then added spikes, healing items and an end target:

The final iteration looks like this:

As a final evaluation of my game, I would say that I am not overly happy with how it turned out however, I did learn a lot making it such as how to make a camera follow the player, how to make a movement script and add it to the player as well as making various prefabs and adding a background which is something I have not done before. I feel like I have learned a lot from this assignment despite the challenges.
